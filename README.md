A js/html standalone/offline* fuelplanner with Flightgear FS interface to set/calc payload and fuel and map the flghtpath and current position of your flight remotely. Useable on nearly each device and browser.

**Quick start:**

a320fuelcalc.html or a330fuelcalc.html in the root directory are completely integrated html files. So you don't have to mess around with additional css and js files. Currently this htmls are to be used for the FGFS IDX-A32x Airbus A320 or A330. Copy the html to a local folder or to a (offline) webserver  and open it with any browser.
