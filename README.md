# Fuelplanner
A js/html standalone/offline* fuelplanner with Flightgear FS interface to set/calc payload and fuel and map the flghtpath and current position of your flight remotely. Useable on nearly each device and browser.

**Quick start:**

a320fuelcalc.html in the root directory is an completely integrated html file. So you don't have to mess around with additional css and js files. Currently this html is to be used for the FGFS IDX-A32x Airbus A320. Save the html local or on a (offline) webserver you can reach with your devices and open it.
